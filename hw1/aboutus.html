    <p>My story started at the ripe young age of 4 when I made my first crisp,
    fresh glass of homemade lemonade. I was hooked and wanted to share my love of
    this God sent beverage with the world! With the help of mom and some spare
    cardboard we found in the garage, we constructed my first lemonade stand.</p>
    <p>Then in the summer of '69, on a hot hot day I came back from retrieving more
    ice inside to find my lemonade stand ablaze. Apparently, the rays of the
    sun had been concentrated by my lemonade pitcher and lit the top cardboard
    surface on fire. The stand was gone before I even considered grabbing the
    garden hose.</p>
    <p>I was distraught for days as I reassessed the sole purpose of my life. Then
    one magical morning, I stepped outside and saw a brand new, yellow VW bus
    standing on the driveway! My mom had gathered all her life's savings to give
    me an opportunity to share my passion with the country. I've been spreading
    cheer from coast to coast ever since.
